- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Pinia** for state management
- **IndexedDB** for local data storage
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **ESLint** with Microsoft-endorsed rules

### Backend
- **Node.js 24** with Express

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ScholarTrack
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install all dependencies (client and server)
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in the root directory
   echo "NODE_ENV=development" > .env
   ```

## Development

### Start Development Servers
```bash
# Start both client and server in development mode
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Client: http://localhost:3000 (Vite dev server)
- Server: http://localhost:5000 (Express API server)

### Development Scripts
```bash
# Start only the client
npm run client:dev

# Start only the server
npm run server:dev

# Type checking (after installing dependencies)
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint:check

# Linting with auto-fix
npm run lint
```

## Building for Production

### Build the Application
```bash
# Build both client and server
npm run build
```

This will:
- Compile TypeScript server code to `dist/server/`
- Build Vue client to `client/dist/`
- Optimize assets for production

### Start Production Server
```bash
npm start
```

The production server will serve the built client files and handle API requests.

## Data Structure

### Student Object
```typescript
interface Student {
  id: string
  label: string        // 2 letters (e.g., "JD")
  code: string         // 4 digits (e.g., "1234")
  emoji: string        // 1-2 characters (e.g., "üòä")
  classes: string[]    // Array of class names
  createdAt: string    // ISO timestamp
}
```

### Transaction Object
```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id?: number
  studentLabel: string
  status: StudentStatus
  timestamp: string
  className: string
  eventType?: TeacherEventType
}
```

### Status Types
- `DEFAULT`: Default student status (blue)
- `RESTROOM`: Student in restroom (orange)
- `OFFICE`: Student in office (red)
- `COUNSELOR`: Student with counselor (purple)

## Local-First Architecture

The application uses a local-first approach:
1. **IndexedDB** stores all data locally for offline functionality
2. **Real-time updates** work without internet connection
3. **Sync capabilities** when connection is available
4. **Automatic conflict resolution** for data consistency

## Security Considerations

- Teacher codes should be set via VITE_TEACHER_CODE environment variable
- Student codes should be unique and kept private
- All administrative actions require teacher authentication
- Data is stored locally with encryption capabilities
